    <p id="about">Kedijaandco was found in the year 2018 by a group of five young Tanzanian girls
        <br>They realised that Tanzanian artists are not being valued neither is the culture.
        <br>Kids nowdays do not even know the kind of art that Tanzania has in its culture. 
        <br>This is mainly caused by the impact of Globalization to culture which dates
        <br> back to the era before and after colonialism where most Tanzanians had
        <br> already started adopting the the Western culture and Globalization
        <br> just catalysed it.One of the founders speaks of how she grew up
        <br> not knowing all of the art genre in Tanzanian culture. She
        <br> walked around Posta one day and met a random man who had
        <br> sketched her in five minutes in exchange of money. 
        <br> That incident sparked a fire in her to help 
        <br>talented Tanzanians have a plattform for 
        <br> identifying artists, showcasing their
        <br> talents and selling their arts at
        <br> a reasonable price.
